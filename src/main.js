//NO LEANING
//A game by Ari Iramanesh, Aurelia Swift, and Simone Barie
//completed 5/3/2020

//Create tilt
// This game twists the endless runner genre by randomly changing the orientation of player
// movement as you fall through differently themed worlds
//We wanted to make something different then just having a character run from left to right!


//Visual style
//All visual art assets were created by members of the team. We tried to have a basic cartoony style for our game :)
//the sound effects and background music were taken from free use websites looperman.com
